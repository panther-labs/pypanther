Prototyping for large changes to panther-analysis

## Local Development
we recommend using poetry for python environment management.

To install the version of pypanther in this repository, run `poetry install` from anywhere within the repository.

pypanther commands are expected to be run from a directory containing a `main.py` file, so if running from this
repository, they must be run from `pypanther/pypanther/`.
